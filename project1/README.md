Star Wars Tic-Tac-Toe: The X's and O's Awaken

### Project Description

In December of 2015, the denizens of General Assembly tasked a group of upstart, aspiring web developers  with updating five classic games for the digital age. Among those budding code monkeys was a "young" charge, Chris Mahr, who was responsible for transforming TIC-TAC-TOE into a captivating arcade game for the web.

Having been lucky enough to watch the recently released "The Force Awakens" during the second day of Project Week, Chris pursued a Star Wars theme for his game. In place of X's were X-wing fighters, and in place of O's were Death Stars. They were but two aspects of the project designed in homage of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

### Instructions

Even in a time of (star) war(s), there are rules. As a reminder, the sequence of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe is as follows:

  1. Player X makes the first move by clicking on one of the nine boxes on the game board. Only a direct click on one of the boxes will mark it.
  2. Player O will make the second move, claiming a box with the same method described in Step 1.
  3. Players X and O alternate moves until either one player links three boxes in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally (resulting in a victory for that player) or all nine boxes on the board are filled with no victor, which results in a tie.

**ONE VERY IMPORTANT RULE TO FOLLOW:** Clicking on a box that has already been claimed for either X or O will result in a loss of turn. Be sure to avoid an itchy trigger finger, or it could mean the difference in the game.

Additionally, it is recommended by the game's creator to play the game with the sound of the computer on. Several sound effects consisting of iconic moments from the franchise - none of which come from "The Force Awakens," so no need to worry about any spoilers - have been built into the game for your listening and nostalgic pleasure.
